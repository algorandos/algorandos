## Introduction to AlgoRandos

AlgoRandos are unique visual artworks created by custom software based on the [CLIP neural network](https://openai.com/blog/clip/). Each image is generated by a machine learning system, using only text parameters as the input.

## How are these made?

The text prompts used to create the images are typically made up of a description of a scene or character, and a description of the image style. The image begins as random noise and a neural net trained to classify images optimizing the output over many iterations so it better represents the text prompt.

The scripting developed for AlgoRandos uses multiple stages to refine the image. The first stages have a high rate of change, and often vary drastically over a few iterations. The later stages condense the imagery to be more coherent and improve the aesthetic clarity. Many of the images produced are manually filtered out and only the most interesting creations are finalized. The filtering process may change or be removed as the overall technique is refined. Most images take at least 500 iterations on a special GPU operating for more than 30 minutes to generate.

## Community Creative Contribution

Future sets of AlgoRandos NFTs will incorporate community contributed text prompt. Unique and creative text prompts can produce fascinating, surprising results. The more creativity applied to this technology, the more interesting the outcome is likely to be. This project will eventually use crowd-sourced, and crowd-sourced weighting of which prompts are selected by a random number generator.

## Rando Token
Rando is an Algorand ASA token ([#339049094](https://algoexplorer.io/asset/339049094)) created for the this project. Rando tokens are given to participants and supporters of the project. The token can be used to vote for the selection generative artwork prompts. Eventually, Rando prompt staking may allow for royalty rights assignment for NFTs generated and minted based on the prompt.

## Get Involved
The full development roadmap for the AlgoRandos project is ambitious and will depend on the success of the earlier phases. The image generation back-end, a voting interface web front-end, and a smart contract for handling NFT minting are the three distinct areas of development. Early phase Rando distribution and prompt-voting will be settled manually in order to demonstrate the core concepts of the project.

The [subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/algorandos) and [discord](https://discord.gg/whWsRS2QCs) are available for project discussion.

The [github project](https://github.com/algorandos) will host public code, wiki, and issue trackers.

The [twitter account](https://twitter.com/algorandos) will announce NFT releases and creative cycle openings.
